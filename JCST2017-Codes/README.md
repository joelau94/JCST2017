# Experiment codes

## Directory `LSTM_train`

Training of LSTM models (our method).

In directories for each experiment lies a sub-directory `data`, in which a data file `acl_5_50.txt` should be contained before you can run the experiment.

### main_exp

BiLSTM model

+ all error types
+ w/ attention

### att_4err

BiLSTM model

+ 4 error types
+ w/ attention

### noatt_allerr

UniLSTM model

+ all error types
+ w/o attention

### noatt_4err

UniLSTM model

+ 4 error types
+ w/o attention

### att_unierr

BiLSTM model

+ all error types
+ w/ attention
+ error generated w/o linguistic knowledge

## Directory `Baselines`

Before you can run baseline training you need to merge the generated data in `LSTM_train` into 2 files, one containing texts and the other labels, namely `acl_min_2.src.txt`, `acl_min_2.lbl.txt`.

SVM requires a KenLM language model. Conv requires an intermediate data file.

### SVM_train

The SVM baseline.

+ Contains code for training and testing on a held out set of training data.
+ Requires KenLM language model `acl.klm` and training data `acl_min_2.src.txt`, `acl_min_2.lbl.txt` in this directory
+ Training data generated by codes in LSTM_train. Switching between artificial error w/ or w/o linguistic knowledge can be done by using different data.

### CNN_train

The Conv baseline.

+ Contains code for training and testing on a held out set of training data.
+ Requires `2_acl.oov.txt` generated in `LSTM_train` and training data `acl_min_2.src.txt`, `acl_min_2.lbl.txt` in sub-directory `corpus`
+ Training data generated by codes in LSTM_train. Switching between artificial error w/ or w/o linguistic knowledge can be done by using different data.

### SVM_dev_test

SVM baseline validation and test.

+ Contains human-annotated data, and code for validation and testing on that data.
+ Requires KenLM language model `acl.klm` in `dev` and `test` directory.
+ Need to manually copy model files in training directories to `models` directory.

### CNN_dev_test

CNN baseline validation and test.

+ Contains human-annotated data, and code for validation and testing on that data.
+ Need to manually copy model files in training directories to `nnModel` directory, and language models to `LM` directory.

## Directory `LSTM_dev_test`

Testing of LSTM models (our method).

+ Copy dictionary files from corresponding training directory to `dict`, and model files to `model`.
+ Overwrite `models.py` with the file of same name from the training directory. (The file here comes from `main_exp`)
+ Overwrite dataset contained in `data`. (Dataset here is testing data, development data may come from directories of other baselines)
