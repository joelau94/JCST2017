The following notations are used throughout the paper . 
The relations of those parameters are , _MATHDISP_ . 
Thus one sees a tradeoff : less general schemes can gain efficiency , but only at the price of certain kinds of cross-platform incompatibilities . 
Thus we should view scalability of P2P solutions with some skepticism , and not accept the claim that a system scales well until we 've undertaken an analysis that includes costs associated with churn . 
Ficus is also known for work on stackable file systems , in which a single file system interface is used to provide access to a variety of types of file-like abstractions . 
And we let _MATH_ . 
So , the problem of multi-processor scheduling is reduced to monoprocessor sub-solutions .
